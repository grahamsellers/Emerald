Emerald
=======

OpenGL 4.3-based rendering engine written by kbi/Elude.
It is Windows-only for the time being. A Linux port is
in the workings.

This hobbistic project is in incessant, over-night
development, hence may not necessarily compile or build
at all times. Please feel free to use it as a KB.

I regularly test Emerald against the latest Intel and NVIDIA drivers.
Always ensure your video drivers are up-to-date before running
any projects found in the solution.
