Emerald
=======

OpenGL 4.3-based rendering engine written by kbi/Elude.
It is Windows-only for the time being.

A Linux port is in the workings at the moment. It is a lot
of work, so it will take a little while before the port sees
the light of day. You can check the latest status by having
a look at the branch issue55.

Emerald is 32-bit-only at the moment. 64-bit compatibility
is considered to be of low priority, but I guess it will
eventually happen :-)

This hobbistic project is in incessant, over-night
development, hence may not necessarily compile or build
at all times. Please feel free to use it as a KB.

I regularly test Emerald against the latest Intel and NVIDIA drivers.
Always ensure your video drivers are up-to-date before running
any projects found in the solution.
